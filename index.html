    <!--Use the prompt and confirm functions (each at least once) to collect choices from the user (the entire story will take place in dialog boxes,
        so your body element could actually be empty, apart from the script element to include your JavaScript)
        Use if, else if, and else to branch the story, based on user choices
        In at least one branch, there should be at least 3 choices for the user to make
        Include at least one branch where different things can happen each time with Math.random()
        Use a logical operator (&& or ||) at least once, where it makes sense
        It should be impossible for an error to ever occur when playing your game, including handling for null/undefined where appropriate
        All string input should be normalized, so that extra whitespace or a letter that's the wrong case will never cause a failed match
        At least one number value is collected and used in a comparison (don't forget to convert it into a number first)
        Don't get too carried away â€” it can be tempting to build a complex video game, but remember, you can always come back
        and build on this project later-->
